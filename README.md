===WHAT IT IS===
Nova54 is a free mod menu making tool for ScriptHookV.NET that makes making a mod menu easier and customizable.
You can set colors of title box, not selected box, selection box, selected box's text, not selected box's text, title text.
If you would like to, you can make the title box gradient.

===HOW TO USE===
To help use this, I made a functions folder where in the folder each folder is a class. In there you can find text files which are the 
methods and properties you can access.
